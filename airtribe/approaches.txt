Questions: Is array sorted, unique, contains negative values & 0,
Approaches: 2 pointer, hashmap, hashmap with prefix sum count, binary search, recursion, graph
Algorithms: Merge sort, quick sort, Patience sort, Topological sort (kahn's algo), Dijkstra's algorithm
Traversals: PreOrder, inorder, postorder & level order

Problems in mind:
shortest path in unweighted graph,
detect a cycle (linked list, graph)
Minimum spanning tree (binary, graph)
