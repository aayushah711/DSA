Questions: Is array sorted, unique, contains negative values & 0,
Approaches: 2 pointer, hashmap, hashmap with prefix sum count, binary search, recursion, graph
Algorithms: Merge sort, quick sort, Patience sort, Topological sort (kahn's algo), Dijkstra's algorithm, Union find (Disjoint set)
Traversals: PreOrder, inorder, postorder & level order

Problems in mind:
shortest path in unweighted graph,
detect a cycle (linked list, graph)
Minimum spanning tree (binary, graph

"in" is for key "of" is for value
Don't say your expectations by mistake

For Calculator: 
- "+", "-", "(", ")". You can parse left to right. Use a stack for brackets. Remember the sign.
- "+", "-", "*", "/". You can parse left to right. Remember prev_operation curr_operation prev_res curr_res

For finding the row & col value in a matrix:
row = Math.floor(mid / n)
col = mid % n

For creating a 2d matrix
let dp = Array.from({ length: n + 1 }, () =>
    Array.from({ length: m + 1 }, () => 0)
  );
  
For doing direct search in dp
let memo = {};
let key = [idx, amt].join(" ")
if (key in memo) return memo[key];
